Description: A group of three utility modules written in Fortran90.
 Libsim encloses a group of three utility modules written in Fortran90:
 .
 libsim_base defines general purpouse classes and modules useful in scientific
 programming, such as execution errors handling, georeferenced data handling,
 time operations and so on.
 .
 libsim_grib defines some classes to handle I/O operations on GRIB files. These
 classes are built upon the ECMWF library.
 .
 libsim_vol7d defines some classes to handle meteorological observational data
 both from the computational point of view and from their persistance in a
 database like DbAll-e or Oracle(TM).
